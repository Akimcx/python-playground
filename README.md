# Python Playground

Where I can experiment and share Python code  
_All of those are dummy programs intended to be **dummy programs** that explore various topics and intrinsics of the Python programming language_

## vowels

This program count the number of vowels in the provided `INPUT` & given the optional `-r` argument it prints a report of the sum of each vowel  
**TODO**

- [ ] When `INPUT` is not provided, get it interactively
- [ ] Accept many `INPUT`
- [ ] Accept a file as `INPUT`

### Quick Run

```python
python3 vowels.py [-r] INPUT
```

## ccipher

This program encrypt or decrypt the provided `TEXT` using the Ceasar Cipher & given the optional `-k` argument it uses a different shift then the default `3`  
**TODO**

- [ ] When `TEXT` is not provided, get it interactively
- [ ] Accept many `TEXT`
- [ ] Accept a file as `TEXT`

### Quick Run

```python
python3 ccipher.py {encrypt,decrypt} [-r] TEXT
```
